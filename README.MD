# AI GALLERY

## Overview

The **Image Sharing AI Project** is a web application that allows users to upload and share images generated by artificial intelligence. Built with NestJS for the backend, Next.js for the frontend, and MongoDB as the database, this project provides a seamless and efficient way for users to showcase and distribute AI-generated content.

### Key Features

- **User Image Upload:** Users can easily upload images generated by AI algorithms.

- **Cloudinary Integration:** Uploaded images are stored and managed using Cloudinary, a cloud-based media management solution.

- **Sharing Functionality:** The platform facilitates easy sharing of uploaded images, providing unique URLs for each piece of content.

- **NestJS Backend:** The backend, developed with NestJS, handles server-side logic, ensuring a robust and scalable architecture.

- **Next.js Frontend:** The frontend, powered by Next.js, delivers a responsive and dynamic user interface.

- **MongoDB Database:** MongoDB is employed to store user data, while Cloudinary is used for efficient image storage and retrieval.

### How It Works

1. **User Uploads Image:**
   - Users navigate to the platform and upload AI-generated images through an intuitive interface.

2. **Cloudinary Storage:**
   - Images are stored in Cloudinary, providing secure and reliable cloud-based storage.

3. **Content Sharing:**
   - Each uploaded image is assigned a unique URL from Cloudinary, allowing users to easily share their creations with others.

4. **Backend Processing:**
   - The NestJS backend processes user requests, interacting with both MongoDB and Cloudinary for seamless image handling.

5. **Dynamic Frontend:**
   - The Next.js frontend provides a dynamic and responsive user experience, enhancing the overall usability of the application.
